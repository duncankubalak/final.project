Made by Duncan Kubalak and Dario Guerra.


This will enable the user to enter keys on their keyboard, and play coresponding notes through the raspberry pi and the robot.

In order to use this you will need to git clone http://github.com/seattleacademy/spring44 and then npm install. After doing this, you will need to replace the files named index.html, server.js, and robotserver.js with the ones of the same names included in this repository.

To see this project in action, watch: https://youtu.be/3m92oD1EOv4 this video briefly shows what this program can do.
